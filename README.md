📊 Kimia Farma Business Performance Analytics

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio project!

In this case study, I analyzed Kimia Farma's business performance from 2020 to 2023 using real-world inspired datasets to uncover insights on transactions, revenue, customer satisfaction, and regional profitability.

📌 Project Overview
Company: Kimia Farma – one of Indonesia’s largest pharmaceutical companies, with operations across retail pharmacies, clinics, and diagnostic labs.
Objective: To transform scattered operational data into actionable insights that support strategic decision-making across branches and regions.

💡 Business Questions:
1. What is Kimia Farma’s performance trend from 2020 to 2023 (transactions, revenue, and profit)?

2. How satisfied are customers with their transaction experience?

3. Which branch types contribute the most to total sales?

4. Which provinces dominate in transactions and revenue, and why?

5. Are there branches with high location ratings but low transaction ratings?

6. How is profit distributed across regions, and which provinces underperform?

🧰 Tools Used
- Google BigQuery Data Preparing,	Data processing, and transformation
- Google Looker Studio	Data visualization dashboard

📂 Dataset Overview
The data consists of four CSV files:

kf_final_transaction.csv — transaction records (date, price, discount, rating)

kf_inventory.csv — product availability by branch

kf_kantor_cabang.csv — branch location, type, and rating

kf_product.csv — product details and categories

🧠 Key Insights
West Java leads in both transaction volume and total revenue.

All three branch formats (Apotek, Klinik & Apotek, Klinik–Apotek–Lab) show balanced contributions to total sales.

Branches like Sorong and Cikampek have high location ratings (>4.6) but relatively lower transaction experience ratings (4.0) — indicating a service gap.

Profitability is regionally uneven, with eastern provinces showing growth potential but lower margins.
